### Feedback 
- Good work. Can see your effort on this assignment.
- Question 4,5: you may misunderstand the question. 
- Question 6: merge the file first, then set words unique. Otherwise, you can not remove the same words which is redundant in two files. 
- Question 7: I did not cut marks for this question this time, please read the question more carefully. And try to use loop to build dictionary instead of manually create it (think if you have thousands of usernames to count)
